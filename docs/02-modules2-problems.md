## Recommended Problems

From DF, Section 10.3, p. 356ff. Note that $R$ is assumed to have a unit element. 

### Problem 1

Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are sets of the same cardinality then $F(A)$ and $F(B)$ are isomorphic.

### Problem 2

Prove that, if $R$ is commutative, then $R^{n}$ and $R^{m}$ are isomorphic if and only if $n=m$. 

**Note:** This is false if $R$ is not commutative.  Problem 27 constructs an example. 

### Problem 6

Prove that if $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module generated by $n$ elements, then any quotient of $M$
can be generated by at most $n$ elements.  In particular, quotients of cyclic modules are cyclic. 

### Problems 16 and 17

These two problems establish the decomposition theorem for modules. Let $M$ be a module and
let $I$ and $J$ be ideals of $R$.

- Prove that the map $M\to M/IM \times M/JM$ defined by $m\mapsto (m+IM, m+JM)$ is an $R$ module homomorphism
with kernel $IM\cap JM$.
- Suppose that $I+J=R$.  Prove thatthe map in the previous part is surjective and its kernel is $IJM$
so that
$$
M/IJM = M/IM\times M/JM
$$
in this case.

This can be extended by induction to families of ideals $I_1,\ldots, I_k$ that are pairwise relatively prime ($I_i+I_j=R$ for any pair.)

### Problem 24 (optional)

This problem constructs an infinite direct product of free modules that is not free; in fact it shows that the countable
direct product of copies of $\Z$ is not free.
