## Field Extensions

### Classical Constructions (Ruler and Compass)

Classical ruler and compass constructions allow one to:

- find the point of intersection of two lines.
- find the point of intersection of a line and a circle.
- find the points of intersection of two circles.

### Constructions

If we begin with a line segment of length 1, we can:

- construct a perpendicular, and then construct all integer lengths along that line
- construct all points with integer coordinates in the plane
- using similar triangles, construct all points in the plane with rational coordinates

### Extensions

Now suppose we can construct all points with coordinates in a field $F$.  Then:

- intersections of lines joining points of over $F$ meet in points with coordinates in $F$
- intersections of a line joining two points with coordinates in $F$ with a circle of radius in $F$ yields points in a quadratic extension of $F$.
- intersections of two circles with radii in $F$ yields points with coordinates in a quadratic extension of $F$.

### Gauss's Theorem on constructibility

**Theorem:** If a line segment of length $\alpha$ is constructible by ruler and compass, then $\alpha$ lies in a field obtained from $\Q$
by a sequence of quadratic extensions, and $[F(\alpha):F]=2^k$ for some integer $k\ge 0$. 

**Corollary:** One cannot "double the cube" , trisect an angle,  or square the circle.

Here doubling the cube means given a length $\alpha$ construct a length $\beta$ so that the cube with side length $\beta$ has double the volume of the
cube with side length $\alpha$.  This is impossible because $\sqrt[3]{2}$ does not meet Gauss's criterion.

Squaring the circle means, given $\alpha$,  constructing a length $\beta$ so that a square of side $\beta$ has the same area as a circle of radius $\alpha$.
This is impossible because $\pi$ is not algebraic (we won't prove this).

Trisecting the angle means constructing an angle with one-third the measure of a given angle $\theta$.  If we can trisect $\theta$, we can construct a length
of $\cos(\theta/3).$  If $\theta=\pi/3$, then $\theta/3=\pi/9$ or $\beta=\cos 20^{\circ}$.  One can show that, if $u=2\beta$, then
$$
u^3-3u-1=0.
$$
This polynomial has no rational roots (it is irreducible mod $2$ for example).

A pentagon is constructible because the $\cos(2\pi/5)$ is the root of a quadratic polynomial.  


## Splitting Fields (Normal Extensions)

### Definition

**Definition:** Let $f(x)\in F[x]$ be a polynomial and let $K/F$ be an extension field. $K$ is called a *splitting field* for $f(x)$ if

- $f$ splits into linear factors in $K$
- $f$ does *not* split into linear factors over any proper subfield of $K$.

### Splitting fields exist

**Proposition:** Any polynomial $f(x)\in F[x]$ has a splitting field. 

**Proof:** If all irreducible factors of $f(x)$ have degree 1 then $F$ is a splitting field.  Otherwise, let $\alpha$ be a root of
an irreducible factor of $f$ of degree greater than $1$ and let $F_1=F(\alpha)$.  Write $f(x)=(x-\alpha)f_1(x)$ and, by induction, let
$E$ be a splitting field for $f_1(x)$ over $F(\alpha)$. Then all the roots of $f(x)$ belong to $E$.  Let $K$ be the subfield of $E$
generated over $F$ by the roots of $f(x)$.  This is your splitting field.

**Remark:** Some books say that if $K/F$ is the splitting field over $F$ for a polynomial, then $K$ is called a normal extension.

### Degrees of splitting fields

**Proposition:** If $f(x)\in F[x]$ has degree $n$ then its splitting field has degree at most $n!$.

Proof: It can be obtained by adjoining roots successively of polynomials of degree $n$, $n-1$, \ldots.

## Examples

1. $f(x)=(x^2-2)(x^2-3).$  Splitting field is $\Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$ which has degree 4.  
2. $f(x)=x^3-2$ which is irreducible by Eisenstein.  Three roots are $\sqrt[3]{2},\omega\sqrt[3]{2},\omega^2\sqrt[3]{2}$ where $\omega=e^{2\pi i/3}$ is a cube
root of one. Since
$$
\omega = \frac{-1+\sqrt{-3}}{2}
$$
this field has degree six and contains $\sqrt{-3}$. 
3. $x^4+4$ "looks irreducible" but it isn't.  It factors as $(x^2+2x+2)(x^2-2x+2)$.  It splits over the field $\Q(i)$ because
$(\pm 1 \pm i)^2=\pm 2i$ so $(\pm 1 \pm i)^4=-4.$ 
4. The splitting field of $x^n-1$ is called the $n^{th}$ cyclotomic field and is generated by $e^{2\pi a/n}$ where $a$ is an integer relatively prime to $n$.
If $n$ is prime, then $x^p-1$ then it factors as $(x-1)(1+x+\cdots+x^{p-1})$; the second factor is irreducible so that field has degree $p-1$.
5. The splitting field of  $x^p-2$ has degree $p(p-1)$.
