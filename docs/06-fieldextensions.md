## Field Extensions

### Classical Constructions (Ruler and Compass)

Classical ruler and compass constructions allow one to:

- find the point of intersection of two lines.
- find the point of intersection of a line and a circle.
- find the points of intersection of two circles.

### Constructions

If we begin with a line segment of length 1, we can:

- construct a perpendicular, and then construct all integer lengths along that line
- construct all points with integer coordinates in the plane
- using similar triangles, construct all points in the plane with rational coordinates

### Extensions

Now suppose we can construct all points with coordinates in a field $F$. Then:

- intersections of lines joining points of over $F$ meet in points with coordinates in $F$
- intersections of a line joining two points with coordinates in $F$ with a circle of radius in $F$ yields points in a quadratic extension of $F$.
- intersections of two circles with radii in $F$ yields points with coordinates in a quadratic extension of $F$.

### Gauss's Theorem on constructibility

**Theorem:** If a line segment of length $\alpha$ is constructible by ruler and compass, then $\alpha$ lies in a field obtained from $\Q$
by a sequence of quadratic extensions, and $[F(\alpha):F]=2^k$ for some integer $k\ge 0$.

**Corollary:** One cannot "double the cube" , trisect an angle, or square the circle.

Here doubling the cube means given a length $\alpha$ construct a length $\beta$ so that the cube with side length $\beta$ has double the volume of the
cube with side length $\alpha$. This is impossible because $\sqrt[3]{2}$ does not meet Gauss's criterion.

Squaring the circle means, given $\alpha$, constructing a length $\beta$ so that a square of side $\beta$ has the same area as a circle of radius $\alpha$.
This is impossible because $\pi$ is not algebraic (we won't prove this).

Trisecting the angle means constructing an angle with one-third the measure of a given angle $\theta$. If we can trisect $\theta$, we can construct a length
of $\cos(\theta/3).$ If $\theta=\pi/3$, then $\theta/3=\pi/9$ or $\beta=\cos 20^{\circ}$. One can show that, if $u=2\beta$, then

$$
u^3-3u-1=0.
$$

This polynomial has no rational roots (it is irreducible mod $2$ for example).

A pentagon is constructible because the $\cos(2\pi/5)$ is the root of a quadratic polynomial.

## Splitting Fields (Normal Extensions)

### Definition

**Definition:** Let $f(x)\in F[x]$ be a polynomial and let $K/F$ be an extension field. $K$ is called a _splitting field_ for $f(x)$ if

- $f$ splits into linear factors in $K$
- $f$ does _not_ split into linear factors over any proper subfield of $K$.

### Splitting fields exist

**Proposition:** Any polynomial $f(x)\in F[x]$ has a splitting field.

**Proof:** If all irreducible factors of $f(x)$ have degree 1 then $F$ is a splitting field. Otherwise, let $\alpha$ be a root of
an irreducible factor of $f$ of degree greater than $1$ and let $F_1=F(\alpha)$. Write $f(x)=(x-\alpha)f_1(x)$ and, by induction, let
$E$ be a splitting field for $f_1(x)$ over $F(\alpha)$. Then all the roots of $f(x)$ belong to $E$. Let $K$ be the subfield of $E$
generated over $F$ by the roots of $f(x)$. This is your splitting field.

**Remark:** Some books say that if $K/F$ is the splitting field over $F$ for a polynomial, then $K$ is called a normal extension.

### Degrees of splitting fields

**Proposition:** If $f(x)\in F[x]$ has degree $n$ then its splitting field has degree at most $n!$.

Proof: It can be obtained by adjoining roots successively of polynomials of degree $n$, $n-1$, \ldots.

## Examples

1. $f(x)=(x^2-2)(x^2-3).$ Splitting field is $\Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$ which has degree 4.
2. $f(x)=x^3-2$ which is irreducible by Eisenstein. Three roots are $\sqrt[3]{2},\omega\sqrt[3]{2},\omega^2\sqrt[3]{2}$ where $\omega=e^{2\pi i/3}$ is a cube
   root of one. Since
   $$
   \omega = \frac{-1+\sqrt{-3}}{2}
   $$
   this field has degree six and contains $\sqrt{-3}$.
3. $x^4+4$ "looks irreducible" but it isn't. It factors as $(x^2+2x+2)(x^2-2x+2)$. It splits over the field $\Q(i)$ because
   $(\pm 1 \pm i)^2=\pm 2i$ so $(\pm 1 \pm i)^4=-4.$
4. The splitting field of $x^n-1$ is called the $n^{th}$ cyclotomic field and is generated by $e^{2\pi a/n}$ where $a$ is an integer relatively prime to $n$.
   If $n$ is prime, then $x^p-1$ then it factors as $(x-1)(1+x+\cdots+x^{p-1})$; the second factor is irreducible so that field has degree $p-1$.
5. The splitting field of $x^p-2$ has degree $p(p-1)$.

## Uniqueness of splitting fields

### Extensions of isomorphisms

**Theorem:** (DF Theorem 27 p. 541) Let $\phi: F\to F'$ be a field isomorphism. Let $f(x)\in F[x]$ and let $f'(x)\in F'[x]$ be the polynomial
obtained from $f$ by applyting $\phi$ to its coefficients. Let $E/F$ be a splitting field of $f$ and let $E'/F'$ be a splitting field of $f'$.
Then there is an isomorphism $\sigma:E\to E'$ which makes the following diagram commutative (the vertical arrows are the inclusion maps):

$$
\begin{xy}\xymatrix{
E \ar[r]^{\sigma} & E' \\
F\ar[u]\ar[r]^{\phi} & F'\ar[u] \\
}
\end{xy}
$$

**Corollary:** Any two splitting fields for $f(x)$ are isomorphic via an isomorphism that is the identity on $F$.

### More on extensions

The extension theorem can seem a little mysterious. Let's look more closely at an application.

Let $f(x)=x^3-2$ and let $E/\Q$ be its splitting field (which has degree 6 over $\Q$). Inside this field there are three isomorphic cubic
extensions: $L_1=\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$, $L_2=\Q(\omega\sqrt[3]{2})$, and $L_3=\Q(\omega^2\sqrt[3]{2})$ where $\omega=e^{2\pi i/3}$ is a cube root of unity.

$$
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
& E & \\
L_1\ar[ur] & L_2\ar[u] & L_3\ar[ul] \\
& \Q\ar[ur]\ar[u]\ar[ul] &\\
}
\end{xy}
$$

Now $E$ is a splitting field for $f(x)$ over each of $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$.

### Still more on extensions

We can apply the theorem to (for example) the diagram

$$
\begin{xy}\xymatrix{
E \ar[r]^{\sigma} & E \\
\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})\ar[u]\ar[r]^{\phi} & \Q(\omega\sqrt[3]{2})\ar[u] \\
}
\end{xy}
$$

where $\phi$ is the isomorphism that sends $\sqrt[3]{2}\to\omega\sqrt[3]{2}$ and fixes $\Q$. It follows that there is an automorphism $\sigma$
of the splitting field that extends $\phi$.

### Automorphisms of splitting fields of irreducibles

In general, if $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial over $F$, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two roots of $f(x)$ in its splitting field $E/F$,
then there is an automorphism $E\to E$ fixing $F$ sending $\alpha$ to $\beta$. In particular the automorphism group of $E$ fixing $F$ permutes
the roots of $f(x)$ transitively.
