## Basics of field theory

### Things to remember from before.

We already know quite a bit about fields. 

### Characteristic 

If $F$ is a field, then there is a ring homomorphism $\Z\to F$ sending $1\to 1$.  If this map is injective, then:

- we say $F$ has *characteristic zero*
- $F$ contains a copy of the rational numbers
- The field $\Q$ is the *prime subfield* of $F$.

Otherwise the kernel of this map must be a prime ideal $p\Z$ of $\Z$.  In this case:
    
- we say that $F$ has *characteristic $p$*
- $F$ contains a copy of $\Z/p\Z$.
- $\Z/p\Z$ is the *prime subfield* of $F$.

### Maps

If $f:F\to E$ is a homomorphism of fields, it is automatically injective (or zero).

The only field maps $f:\Q\to \Q$ and $f:\Z/p\Z\to \Z/p\Z$ are the identity. 

### Extensions

If $F$ is a field, and $F\subset E$ where $E$ is another field, then we call $E$ an extension field of $F$.

$E$ is automatically a vector space over $F$.  The degree of $E/F$, written $[E:F]$, is the dimension of $E$ as an $F$-vector space.

### Polynomials, quotient rings, and fields

We have the division algorithm for polynomials.  $F[x]$ is a PID.    An ideal is prime iff it is generated by an irreducible polynomial.

Let $p(x)$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $d$ over $F$.  Then:

- $K=F[x]/(p(x))$ is a field
- It is of degree $d$ over $F$.
- $p(x)$ has a root in $K$ (namely the residue class of $x$)
- The elements $1,x,\ldots, x^{d-1}$ are a basis for $K/F$. 

### Adjoining roots of polynomials

If $F\subset K$ is a field extension, and $\alpha\in K$, then $F(\alpha)$ is the smallest subfield of $K$ containing $F$ and $\alpha$.
Similarly for $F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n)$.

If $p(x)$ is irreducible over $F$, and has a root $\alpha$ in $K$, then $F(\alpha)$ is isomorphic to $F[x]/p(x)$ via the map $x\mapsto \alpha$.

### Key Theorem

Let $K$ be a field extension of $F$ and let $p(x)$ be an irreducible polynomial over $F$.  Suppose $K$ contains two roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$
of $p(x)$.  Then $F(\alpha)$ and $F(\beta)$ are isomorphic via an isomorphism that is the identity on $F$.

More generally:

**Theorem:** (See Theorem 8, DF, page 519) Let $\phi:F\to F'$ be an isomorphism of fields.  Let $p(x)$ be an irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ and let
$p'(x)$ be the polynomial in $F'[x]$ obtained by applying $\phi$ to the coefficients of $p(x)$.  Let $K$ be an extension of $F$ containing a root $\alpha$ of
$p(x)$, and let $K'$ be an extension of $F'$ containing a root $\beta$ of $p'(x)$.  Then there is an isomorphism $\sigma:F(\alpha)\to F'(\beta)$ such that
the restriction of $\sigma$ to $F$ is $\phi$.
