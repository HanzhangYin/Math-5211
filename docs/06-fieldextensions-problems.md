## Recommended Problems

### Problem 1

Find the splitting fields of the following polynomials over $\Q$ (some computer help may make this go smoother):

- $x^4-2$
- $x^4+2$
- $x^4+x^2+1$
- $x^6-4$

### Problem 2 (DF, Problem 6, page 545)

Prove that, if $K_1/F$ and $K_2/F$ are splitting fields, then so are the composite $K_1K_2$ and the intersection
$K_1\cap K_2$.
