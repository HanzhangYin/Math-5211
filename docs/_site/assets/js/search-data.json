    "content": "Math 5211/4211, Spring Semester 2023 University of Connecticut . Instructor . | Jeremy Teitelbaum | . Introduction . This is the second semester of the year-long graduate-level abstract algebra course at UConn. The 4211 version of the course is open to undergraduates but is the same course. We will cover core topics in module theory, field theory, and multi-linear algebra. Schedule . This course meets (in-person) every Tuesday and Thursday from 11:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. in Monteith 314. Textbook . We will rely on Abstract Algebra, 3rd edition by Dummit and Foote. Campus Wire . We will take advantage of the Q&amp;A site campuswire for online questions and answers. You should register on the site before class starts. Overleaf and TeX . All homework solutions must be submitted in TeX/LaTeX. The easiest way to work with TeX is via the cloud resource overleaf.com. There are many tutorials on that site that provide an introduction to TeX. In addition, this video might be helpful. Prelim Exam Reference . Information about the algebra prelim, including past exams, is available here on the department graduate studies website. Assessment . Grades in this course will be based on: . | Homework (40%) | Two exams (30% each) | . Disclaimer . The instructor reserves the right to modify or adapt this syllabus to account for disruption due to COVID-19 or other unexpected circumstances. University Policies . Students must comply with all university guidelines regarding COVID. Students with disabilities should work with the Center for Students with Disabilities to request academic accommodations. The CSD is located in Wilbur Cross, Room 204 and can be reached at (860) 486-2020 or at csd@uconn.edu. Detailed information regarding the process to request accommodations is available on the CSD website at www.csd.uconn.edu. Students are bound by the university’s policies on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct is dishonest or unethical academic behavior that includes, but is not limited to, misrepresenting mastery in an academic area (e.g., cheating), failing to properly credit information, research, or ideas to their rightful originators or representing such information, research, or ideas as your own (e.g., plagiarism). Students, faculty, and staff are bound by the university’s policy against discrimination, harassment, and related interpersonal violence. ",
