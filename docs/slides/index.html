<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This is the second semester of the year-long graduate-level abstract
algebra course at UConn. The 4211 version of the course is open to
undergraduates but is the same course.</p>
<p>We will cover core topics in module theory, field theory, and
multi-linear algebra.</p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>
<p>This course meets (in-person) every Tuesday and Thursday from 11:00
a.m. to 12:15 p.m. in Monteith 314.</p>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>We will rely on <em>Abstract Algebra, 3rd edition</em> by Dummit and
Foote.</p>
<h3 id="campus-wire">Campus Wire</h3>
<p>We will take advantage of the Q&amp;A site <a
href="https://campuswire.com/c/G8BF642ED/feed">campuswire</a> for online
questions and answers. You should register on the site before class
starts.</p>
<h3 id="overleaf-and-tex">Overleaf and TeX</h3>
<p>All homework solutions must be submitted in TeX/LaTeX. The easiest
way to work with TeX is via the cloud resource <a
href="http://overleaf.com">overleaf.com</a>. There are many tutorials on
that site that provide an introduction to TeX. In addition, <a
href="https://youtu.be/C9Icf9Wvp7U">this video</a> might be helpful.</p>
