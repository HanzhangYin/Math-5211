## Canonical Forms: Preliminaries

### Set-up

Let $F$ be a field, let $V$ be a nontrivial finite dimensional vector space over $F$, and let $T:V\to V$ be a linear transformation.

Then $V$ is an $F[x]$-module.

**Lemma:** $V$ is a finitely generated torsion module over $F[x]$. 

**Proof:** $V$ is generated by a basis, which is finite by assumption.  If $V$ were not torsion, there would be a $v\in V$ so that the
map $F[x]\to V$ given by $f(x)\mapsto f(T)v$ is injective; but that contradicts the fact that $V$ is finite dimensional.

### Eigenvalues and the Characteristic Polynomial.

**Definition:** An element $\lambda\in F$ is an eigevanlue of $T$ if there is a nonzero $v\in V$ with $Tv=\lambda v$. The vector
$v$ is an eigenvector for this eigenvalue.  

**Definition:** Let $c(x)=\det(xI-T)$.  Then $c(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree $n$ called the *characteristic polynomial* of $T$.

**Lemma:** $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ if and only
if $c(\lambda)=0$.

**Proof:** If $c(\lambda)=0$, then $\det(\lambda I-T)=0$ so $\lambda I-T$ has a nontrivial kernel; an element of the kernel is an eigenvector
with eigenvalue $\lambda$.  Conversely, if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue, then $\lambda I -T$ has nontrivial kernel, so its determinant is zero.

### The Minimal polynomial

Since $V$ is a torsion $F[x]$ module, its annihilator
$$
\Ann(V)=\lbrace f(x)\in F[x] : f(T)v=0\forall v\in V
$$
is a nonzero ideal in $F[x]$, hence a principal ideal generated by a unique monic polynomial $m(x)$.  

**Definition:** The unique monic generator $m(x)$ of $\Ann(V)$ is called the minimal polynomial of $T$.  

**Lemma:** The minimal polynomial $m(x)$ is the monic polynomial of minimal degree such that $m(T)v=0$ for all $v\in V$.

**Proof:** By definition $m(T)v=0$ for all $v\in V$.  The collection of polynomials $h(x)$ such that $h(T)v=0$ is exactly $\Ann(V)$,
and the generator of the ideal $\Ann(V)$ in the Euclidean ring $F[x]$ is its monic polynomial element of minimal degree.

### The structure of $V$

By the fundamental theorem of finitely generated modules over PID's, we have two different ways to represent $V$ as an $F[x]$ module.

**Invariant Factors:** There are monic polynomials $f_1(x)\vert f_2(x)\vert\cdots\vert f_k(x)$ such that
$$
V=F[x]/(f_1(x))\oplus F[x]/(f_2(x))\oplus\cdots\oplus F[x]/(f_{k}(x)).
$$

**Elementary Divisors:** There are irreducible polynomials $f_1(x),\ldots, f_k(x)$ and nonnegative integers $e_1,\ldots, e_k$
such that
$$
V=F[x]/(f_1(x)^{e_1})\oplus F[x]/(f_2(x)^{e_2})\oplus\cdots\oplus F[x]/(f_k(x)^{e_k})
$$

The invariant factors are uniquely determined; and the elementary divisors are uniquely determined up to order.

### Invariant factors and the minimal polynomial

**Lemma:** The minimal polynomial $m(x)$ of $T$ is the last (the "largest") invariant factor of $T$ acting on $V$; all the invariant factors divide $m(x)$. 

## The Rational normal form

### The cyclic case

Let's focus our attention for the moment on a cyclic $F[x]$ module of the form $M=F[x]/(f(x))$ where
$$
f(x)=x^{d}+a_{d-1}x^{d-1}+\ldots+a_{0}
$$

- $M$ is a finite dimensional vector space of degree equal to the degree $d$ of $f(x)$.
- $1,x,x^2,\ldots, x^{d-1}$ is a basis for this module.
- $x$ is an $F$-linear transformation $M\to M$.

### Matrix of x

The linear map given by multiplication by $x$ has the following matrix form in the basis $1,x,x^2,\ldots, x^{d-1}$:

$$
[x]=\left(\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 &\cdots &0& -a_0 \\ 1 & 0 & \cdots&0 & -a_1\\ 0 & 1 & \cdots&0 & -a_2\\\vdots & \vdots &\ddots &\vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & -a_{d-1}\end{matrix}\right)
$$


**Definition:** The matrix for $[x]$ above is called the companion matrix for the polynomial $f(x)$.

### Characteristic and minimal polynomials of the companion matrix

**Lemma:** The characteristic and minimal polynomials of this linear transformation are both $f(x)$.

**Proof:** The fact that the characteristic polynomial of $[x]$ is $f(x)$ is a computation.  The fact that $f(x)$ is the minimal polynomial follows
from the fact that $x$ clearly satisfies $f(x)$, and, since $1,x,\ldots, x^{d-1}$ are linearly dependent, there is no relation $\sum a_{i}x^{i}=0$ of degree less than $d$.
